# Perry
Perry is made for a rehabilitation system to help stroke and Parkinson’s patients regain the use of shoulder reach and finger pinch abilities. Featuring a wireless ‘pinch’ controller that moves a cursor to play a list of curated games, Perry challenges cognitive abilities, ensuring patient engagement throughout rehab.
